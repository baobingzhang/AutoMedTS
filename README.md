# AutoMedTS

> **Automating Clinical Time Series Intelligence**  
> An end-to-end AutoML framework tailored for clinical time-series data. Streamline data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty-aware ensemblingâ€”minimal manual effort required. Originally developed to deliver real-time action recognition and feedback
in laparoscopic surgery training. It integrates multiple class-imbalance handling strategies (including power transform, temperature-scaled softmax, and SMOTE). AutoMedTS automatically searches for optimal models and hyperparameters, providing an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference. The framework is easily extensible to other medical time-series tasks and offers comprehensive evaluation metrics (Macro-F1, Balanced Accuracy, MCC) along with visualization tools for performance analysis and feedback.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **One-Click Pipeline**  
  From raw time-series to deployable model in a single `fit()` call.
- **Advanced Imbalance Handling**  
  SMOTE, temperature-scaled Softmax, power-law mapping, jitter augmentation.
- **Meta-Learning Warm-Start**  
  Seed Bayesian optimizer with high-quality configurations from prior tasks.
- **Uncertainty-Aware Ensembling**  
  Greedy forward-selection with variance penalty for robust predictions.
- **Real-Time Inference**  
  High throughput and low latencyâ€”ideal for live surgical feedback.
- **Modular & Extensible**  
  Swap in custom preprocessors, resamplers, models, or metrics.
