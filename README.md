## AutoMedTS

AutoMedTS is an open-source automated machine learning framework designed for medical
time-series data, originally developed to deliver real-time action recognition and feedback
in laparoscopic surgery training. It employs sliding-window segmentation on surgical
suture coordinate sequences and integrates multiple class-imbalance handling strategies
(including power transform, temperature-scaled softmax, and SMOTE). AutoMedTS
automatically searches for optimal models and hyperparameters, providing an end-to-end
pipeline for training and inference. The framework is easily extensible to other medical
time-series tasks and offers comprehensive evaluation metrics (Macro-F1, Balanced
Accuracy, MCC) along with visualization tools for performance analysis and feedback.
